# analyzing_baseball_data
Analyzing Baseball Data is the final project of [Python Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-analysis) course by Rice University in coursera. The course is part of [Introduction to Scripting in Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-scripting-in-python) specialization.
The project focused on writing code that computes several common batting statistics from the data in the provided CSV files.
The code template was provided by the university, and it includes 5 sections:
* Code from earlier week of the course for reading and writing files - 2 functions
* Provided formulas for common batting statistics - 3 functions
* Part 1: Functions to compute top batting statistics by year - 4 functions
* Part 2: Functions to compute top batting statistics by career - 2 functions
* Provided testing code

Description of the file list:
* project_course_3.py - project's code
* Master_2016.csv - a csv file containing players' general information
* Batting_2016.csv - a csv file containing players' batting data
* master1.csv - master4.csv - files representing Mater_2016 file but with less data (testing code)
* batting1.csv - batting4.csv - files representing Batting_2016 file but with less data (for code testing)
